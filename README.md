# Typst templates for different chairs at the University of Duisburg Essen

This repository provides [Typst](https://typst.app/) templates for different chairs at the [UDE](https://www.uni-due.de/).

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that these templates are **not official**, and I **cannot guarantee** that they will be accepted in the future, although I have personally written seminar papers and theses with all of these. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you double-check the provided Microsoft Word or LaTeX templates and verify with your supervisor that the documents you create with these templates fulfill the chair's criteria, in order to avoid negative effects on grading.
>
> These templates are provided on a best-effort basis. It is highly recommended that you have at least a basic understanding of Typst syntax in order to properly use these templates and resolve simple issues without assistance.
